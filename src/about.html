        <p class ="about">
           Government budget allocation is a complicated process of deciding how much is spent and where.
           The purpose of this application will be to reduce the complexity of the process so that the government can analyse its spending,
           and so that the average person can understand how the government allocates the budget.
           In addition, this application will provide transparency for the Prince George’s County government’s budget distribution.

        <h1>Who is impacted?</h1>
        <p class ="about">
          The stakeholders for this problem are the county government, residents of the county, and anyone interested in the budget distribution of the Board of Education.
          The government can use this application to analyze how it is spending money by zip code and by agency.
          This would improve the government's understanding of its spending and how to possibly redistribute funding. 
          This application would help residents by providing them with information about how the government is functioning and if they agree with how money is being allocated. By understanding these facts, the community can better judge who they want to vote for based on the candidates’ funding ideals.

        <h1>What is our solution?</h1>
        <p class ="about">
          We extracted information from the Prince George's2020 spending API and calculate the spending by different zip codes of 
          Prince George’s County and by different agencies.
          Using the calculated amounts, we can visually show what zip codes are spending the most and which are spending the least.
          Based on that information, the user can determine if they believe that one section of the county needs more funding or not,
          or if certain agencies need more funding.
