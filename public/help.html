  On the sign-in page, users can login to their accounts on this website. They can create a new account
  by clicking on "Create a New Account" or update their password using the "Forgot Password?" option. To
  sign-in, users need their IDs and their password. Incorrect passwords will not let them "login". If correct
  password is entered for a specific ID, it displays a "Welcome" message indicating that the "login" was 
  successful. A new account can't be created if there exists another account with the same username. An error message
  ("ERROR") will be displayed if a username already exists.
