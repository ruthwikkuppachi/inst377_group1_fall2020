# User Manual

The proposed website would take information from the 2020 spending API and calculate the spending by different zip codes of Prince George’s County and by different agencies. Using the calculated amounts, we can visually show what zip codes are spending the most and which are spending the least.

This is a useful tool for those who are employeed by the are the PG county government, residents of the county, and anyone interested in the budget distribution of the Board of Education. The government can use this application to analyze how it is spending money by zip code and by agency.
