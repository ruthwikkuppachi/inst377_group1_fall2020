# User Manual

The proposed website would take information from the 2020 spending API and calculate the spending by different zip codes of Prince George’s County and by different agencies. Using the calculated amounts, we can visually show what zip codes are spending the most and which are spending the least. Based on that information, the user can determine if they believe that one section of the county needs more funding or not, or if certain agencies need more funding.

This is a useful tool for those who are employeed by the are the PG county government, residents of the county, and anyone interested in the budget distribution of the Board of Education. The government can use this application to analyze how it is spending money by zip code and by agency. This would improve the government's understanding of its spending and how to possibly redistribute funding. This application would also help residents by providing them with information about how the government is functioning and if they agree with how money is being allocated. By understanding these facts, the community can better judge who they want to vote for based on the candidates’ funding ideals.
